@LienRuD,"Hello everyone! I'm a 31-year-old woman from Russia, and I didn't understand why the world was going crazy over an ordinary pop singer. I'd heard news about her and her popularity, but I rarely listened to snippets of her songs and couldn't comprehend it. Recently, the internet was buzzing about her new album, and I decided to finally listen to her from start to finish, as well as watch her music videos. My world was completely turned upside down! I've been rejecting this diamond for years, but now I can't get enough of her voice, the beauty of her music videos, her lyrics, and her live performances! I just have a lump in my throat, but I'm in the same swamp as you, and I'm very happy!!! 🙏🏻❤️😭",15,2025-11-08T15:44:38Z,positive

💛 She taught us to be fearless
💜 She taught us to speak now and use our voice
❤️ She was there through the heartbreaks

🖤 She taught us that even people can be snakes
🩷 She showed us love is worth it—even if it doesn’t last
🩶 She taught us that storytelling can heal
🤎 She reminded us it’s okay to feel deeply
💙 She stayed with us through the sleepless nights
